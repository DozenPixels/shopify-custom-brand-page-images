##**Shopify** - Custom Brand Page with Hover Images

SHopify does not natively support a page listing all brands, only collections. This is a workaround, requiring you to make a custom page template.

---

####Step 1

Add the included styles to your *custom-styles.css.liquid* file.

####Step 2

Copy and paste the code in the *page.brand_images.liquid* file into your own empty file inside the **Templates** folder.

>You can name the file anything you want, but it must start with **page.** and end with **.liquid**

####Step 3

Go to *Online Store* -> *Pages* -> **Add page**, and choose the newly created template in the dropdown. Create a Title, and enter any text in the *Content* filed, that you want to show up above the brands tiles. Save and Preview.

>Unless your theme uses the Foundation framework, wyou might need to adjust some positioning and grid styles.
